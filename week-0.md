## Basics of Computer Science

- 1byte = 8bits
- 1bits = Binary representation
- Character 'A' -> 65 [ ASCII ], B-> 66, etc..
- Unicode
- Videos -> Sequence of images moved so a phase that it see like a video
- Input -> [ Algorithm ] -> output
- Algorithm : Step by Step Instruction
- Divide and Conquere : Best Example -> In olden days we to search a phone number of a person from phone diary book we could search then number - starting from first page to the nth page but it is very slow process, rather we could randomly go in to some page check the name of the person to search comes on right side or left side of the book, do this process repatedly its much faster search.
  - First Algoirthm looking from first page to nth page, If we have suppose 1024 pages in then time to search a person whose name is "z" would have taken 1024 steps (Worst case).
  - Second Algorithm would only take 10 steps ==> 1024, 512, 1256, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
- Pseudo Code -> Is English like statement which tells the steps to flow to finish the algorithm, It can be written in C, pthon, JS languages
- functions : Tells What to do
- Conditions : branches which tell weather to perform that operation or not
- Boolean Expression : Question (yes/no), (1/0), (true/false)
- Loop : Cycle which is done again
